## Overview
Part of the requirements for the bootcamp was to use a generic template for a portfolio. This version contains an assortment of activities that we had created up to that point.

## About Me
The early draft of our “elevator” pitch that is meant to give an overview of our skills while being engaging.

## Portfolio
A collection of works created. I added some CSS animation for the rollover event to explain the technology used in each activity, skills learned as well as a link to the exercise.

## Contact Me
While the page looks functional, the components of the backend were not available so not server side script was added to implement the submit feature.
